# Welcome to my guide to achieve privacy, if you enjoy it please take a minute to share it.


# The Basics
First steps to privacy, easy to apply.

## Device Password
First line of defense, stop people from accessing your private data.

### My Recommendations
Atleast 8 character password with letters, numbers and special characters.

## Password Managers
It is a problem that most people reuse the password, on the sites they register. I have seen hacked sites leak user info . When a site leaks the user credentials a criminal can use the password to get into your accounts if they share the same password. That is a risk. Use a password manager. Use a different password, for every site you use regularly.

### My Recommendations

Proton Pass: https://proton.me/pass

Bitwarden: https://bitwarden.com/

KeePass: https://keepassxc.org/

## Use 2FA on available services
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) asks for a code. I get the code from the app . Two-Factor Authentication makes sure that even if my password is stolen the hacker cannot get into my account.

### My Recommendations

Proton Authenticator: https://proton.me/authenticator

Aegis: https://getaegis.app

Ente Auth: https://ente.io/auth/

## Disable Google tracking
Google collects a lot of data, about your location, your search history and your app usage. Go to your Google account, you can turn off the activity controls. That limits what Google can learn about you.

### My Recommendations
Google MyActivity Page: https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity

## Remove unused accounts
I have learned that every old account you leave idle is a security risk. When hackers breach the service you no longer use the data, in the account can be exposed to anyone. Delete the accounts you do not need.

## Social Media Warning
Always look at the metadata or accidental audio, they can reveal the location and the identity.

### My Recommendations
Scrambled Exif: https://f-droid.org/packages/com.jarsilio.android.scrambledeggsif/

PrivMeta: https://www.privmeta.com/

## Use a good VPN
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) masks your IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, preventing your ISP from selling your browsing data and hide your location from websites.

### My Recommendations
ProtonVPN: https://protonvpn.com/

Mullvad: https://mullvad.net/en/

IVPN: https://www.ivpn.net/

Windscribe: https://windscribe.com

## Use encrypted messaging
Service providers can read SMS and many chat apps. I suggest you use messaging apps that use End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). End- to-End Encryption (E2EE) makes sure only you and the recipient can read the messages. The messages stay private.

### My Recommendations

Signal: https://signal.org/

Session: https://getsession.org/

## Use encrypted email
Standard email providers scan your inbox, for data. Encrypted email providers cannot read the emails. Encrypted email providers protect your communications.

### My Recommendations

Protonmail: https://proton.me/mail

Tutanota: https://tutanota.com/

## Temporary mails
For the sites that does not need your real email use them to sign up for sites that you will use one time.

### My Recommendations

33Mail: https://www.33mail.com/

Guerilla Mail: https://www.guerrillamail.com/

Tempmail: https://temp-mail.org/

## Use a privacy search engine
I notice that mainstream search engines track each query and use the data to build the advertising profile. Privacy search engines give you only results. They do not log your IP address or your search history.

### My Recommendations

DuckDuckGo: https://duckduckgo.com/

Startpage: https://startpage.com/

searx.me: https://searx.me/

## Telemetry
Opt out of phone and computer tracking
Both Windows and mobile OSs have advertising IDs and telemetry, turn them off.

## Shred files and data
Deleting a file still leaves the file on the disk. Use shredding software to overwrite the file data so the file cannot be restored.

### My Recommendations
Bleachbit: https://www.bleachbit.org/

# Advanced - This is where you start to trade ease of usage for increased privacy.

## Disable all biometrics
Biometrics get stored in the device. Also law enforcement can force you to unlock the phone with biometrics. Law enforcement cannot force you to unlock the phone with a passcode.

## De-Google
De‑Googling your life means you remove all the Google services, apps and accounts. De‑Googling helps to stop them from tracking you. Use open source apps from F-Droid

## Utilize pseudonyms
Never use your real name for online services. Create distinct personas for different activities to hide zyour digital identity from your real one.

## Delete personal social media
Leaving major social platforms eliminates the primary source of voluntary data collection and social graphing used to profile you.

## Use private and secure browsers
Use specialized browsers configured for maximum privacy when consuming video content to prevent viewing habits from being tracked.

### My Recommendations
Firefox: https://www.firefox.com

Brave: https://brave.com

Tor Browser: https://www.torproject.org/download/

## Utilize multiple browsers
Browser variety means you use a browser for each task. It lets you use one browser, for the banking and another browser, stops cross site tracking.

## Move to FOSS
I do not know what Proprietary software does. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) lets me audit the code. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) lets me verify that the backdoors are not there and the spyware is not there.

### My Recommendations

F-Droid: https://www.f-droid.org

AlternativeTo: https://alternativeto.net

## Ditch Stock Android
Stock Android runs on Google’s data collection. The step of leaving the Android ecosystem for alternatives cuts the link to Google’s data collection. The step of leaving the Android ecosystem for alternatives also moves you away from the standard Android ecosystem and, into de‑Googled alternatives.

### My Recommendations

GrapheneOS (Only for Google Pixel Devices) : https://grapheneos.org

LineageOS: https://lineageos.org/

CrDroid: https://crdroid.net/

## Protect computer BIOS
Set a password for your BIOS/UEFI to prevent attackers with physical access from booting from external drives or altering hardware settings.

## Use full disk encryption
When my device is physically stolen, full disk encryption stops the thief from opening my files without the password. Full disk encryption makes the hard drive useless for the thief.

### My Recommendations

Veracrypt: https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html

## Spoof MAC address
I have seen the MAC address used to track devices. Your device’s MAC address is a hardware ID. The MAC address can track you across Wi‑Fi networks.

## Strip OS telemetry and functionality
Use scripts or specialized tools to rip out deep-rooted tracking (telemetry) and unnecessary features from your operating system.

### My Recommendations

Canta: https://github.com/samolego/Canta

Universal-Android-Debloater: https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater

WinUtil: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil

## Ditch Windows
Windows is closed-source. Windows collects a lot of usage data. I find that switching to a privacy‑respecting OS removes the surveillance vector.

### My Recommendations

Linux Mint: https://linuxmint.com/

Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/download

Arch Linux: https://archlinux.org/

## Ditch IOT and smart devices
Go beyond just avoiding them; physically remove any existing smart devices from your home to eliminate always-on listening and data collection points.

## Use privacy screen protectors
The filters limit the viewing angle of the monitor and the phone. The filters keep people from shoulder surfing when I am in a coffee shop or on a train.

## Use camera covers
Even if a hacker gains access, to the camera the hacker cannot see anything.

## Clean your digital footprint
I use the process to search for myself. I then use the process to ask data-broker sites and public directories to delete my data.
